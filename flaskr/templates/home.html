	<h3>Success Stories</h3>

		<h4>Amy:</h4>
	</div>
	<p>In December 2011, I was diagnosed with large diffuse B-cell non-hodgkins lymphoma and spent 6 months in and out of the hospital with 5 consecutive days of a constant chemo drip. 
	   The chemotherapy was increased 20% with each treatment. By the middle of my treatment, the medications were so strong, I needed to two blood transfusions.

	   I am so blessed and grateful for those who gave selflessly. Your blood donations helped save my life. I've been a lifetime donor myself. 
	   Here I am today, just a few short years into my remission and I'm well enough to donate again! Thank you all! God Bless!

		<h4>Nicole:</h4>

	 <p>My son, Chase, was diagnosed on 9/18/2013 with a Stage 3 Anaplastic Ependymoma, Brain Cancer. He survived an 8 hour surgery to remove the tumor the next day. 
	    During the surgery, he needed a blood transfusion and because of wonderful people who donate, they had his blood type on hand. 
	    Thankfully, he had a successful surgery and it has now been 
	    16 months since there was any evidence of disease!
